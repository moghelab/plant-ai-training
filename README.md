A repository of publicly available AI workbooks, tutorials and training infrastructures from across the world, relevant to plant scientists

## High-performance computing training infrastructures
* Please see our manuscript, Supplementary File, for more information

## Plant-related GenAI tools
* [scPlantLLM](https://github.com/compbioNJU/scPlantLLM/tree/main) - a transformer-based model specifically designed for the exploration of single-cell expression atlases in plants
* [Plant Connectome](https://plant.connectome.tools/) - PlantConnectome is a powerful resource providing insights into millions of relationships involving genes, molecules, compartments, stresses, organs, and other plant entities.
* [FuncZyme](https://tools.moghelab.org/funczymedb) - Tools for predicting plant enzyme function, developed using LLM-based extraction of enzyme-substrate interactions
* [PlantCAD](https://www.maizegenetics.net/plantcad) - DNA foundation model trained on plant genomes. PlantCAD enables cross-species genome annotation and deleterious mutation prediction. Also includes a link to a [Google Collab workbook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QW9Lgwra0vHQAOICE2hsIVcp6DKClyhO?usp=sharing) for checking out PlantCAD.

## Public AI-ready datasets
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - Online community for data scientists to share code and datasets. Multiple users can provide Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks and Google Collab workflows for analyzing a given dataset. 

## Workbooks and tutorials
* [Ready-Steady-Go-AI](https://github.com/HarfoucheLab/Ready-Steady-Go-AI) - Supplement to the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921001719), Ready, Steady, Go AI: A Practical Tutorial on Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications in Phenomics Image Analysis. It aims to introduce the basic principles for implementing AI and explainable AI algorithms in image-based data analysis using the PlantVillage dataset to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases and spider mites as a case study.

## Online courses
* [Cornell University - Deep Generative Models course](https://kuleshov-group.github.io/dgm-website/) - a freely available course by Volodymyr Kuleshov. Full video lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/@vkuleshov/playlists) including for the course on Applied Machine Learning. 
* [iGotKarmayogi](https://www.igotkarmayogi.gov.in/#/) - Government of India website for online training of government officials
