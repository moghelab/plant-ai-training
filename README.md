A repository of publicly available AI workbooks, tutorials and training infrastructures from across the world, relevant to plant scientists

## High-performance computing training infrastructures
* Please see our manuscript, Supplementary File, for more information

## Plant-related GenAI tools
* [scPlantLLM](https://github.com/compbioNJU/scPlantLLM/tree/main) - a transformer-based model specifically designed for the exploration of single-cell expression atlases in plants
* [Plant Connectome](https://plant.connectome.tools/) - PlantConnectome is a powerful resource providing insights into millions of relationships involving genes, molecules, compartments, stresses, organs, and other plant entities.
* [FuncZyme](https://tools.moghelab.org/funczymedb) - Tools for predicting plant enzyme function, developed using LLM-based extraction of enzyme-substrate interactions
* [PlantCAD](https://www.maizegenetics.net/plantcad) - DNA foundation model trained on plant genomes. PlantCAD enables cross-species genome annotation and deleterious mutation prediction.

## Public AI-ready datasets
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - Online community for data scientists to share code and datasets. Multiple users can provide Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks and Google Collab workflows for analyzing a given dataset. 

## Workbooks and tutorials
