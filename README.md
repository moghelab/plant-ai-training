A repository of publicly available AI workbooks, tutorials and training infrastructures from across the world, relevant to plant scientists

## High-performance computing training infrastructures
* Please see our manuscript, Supplementary File, for more information

## Generative AI models
### GenAI foundation models trained on plant data
* [scPlantLLM](https://github.com/compbioNJU/scPlantLLM/tree/main) - a transformer-based model specifically designed for the exploration of single-cell expression atlases in plants
* [PlantCAD](https://www.maizegenetics.net/plantcad) - DNA foundation model trained on plant genomes. PlantCAD enables cross-species genome annotation and deleterious mutation prediction. Also includes a link to a [Google Collab workbook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QW9Lgwra0vHQAOICE2hsIVcp6DKClyhO?usp=sharing) for checking out PlantCAD.
 
### Tools in plant science utilizing GenAI models
* [Plant Connectome](https://plant.connectome.tools/) - PlantConnectome is a powerful resource providing insights into millions of relationships involving genes, molecules, compartments, stresses, organs, and other plant entities.
* [FuncZyme](https://tools.moghelab.org/funczymedb) - Tools for predicting plant enzyme function, developed using LLM-based extraction of enzyme-substrate interactions

### General GenAI foundation models useful for plant research
* [ESM](https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm) EvolutionaryScale Models - protein foundation models for sequence and/or structure analysis


## Public AI-ready datasets
### General datasets
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - Online community for data scientists to share code and datasets. Multiple users can provide Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks and Google Collab workflows for analyzing a given dataset.

### Plant-specific datasets

## Workbooks and tutorials for plant science
### GenAI tutorials
* [Plant DNA LLMs](https://github.com/zhangtaolab/Plant_DNA_LLMs) - Supplement to the [paper](https://www.cell.com/molecular-plant/fulltext/S1674-2052(24)00390-3) "PDLLMs: A group of tailored DNA large language models for analyzing plant genomes". The tutorial explains how to utilize a family of DNA foundation models for identifying core plant promoters.

### General AI/ML tutorials
* [Ready-Steady-Go-AI](https://github.com/HarfoucheLab/Ready-Steady-Go-AI) - Supplement to the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921001719), Ready, Steady, Go AI: A Practical Tutorial on Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications in Phenomics Image Analysis. It aims to introduce the basic principles for implementing AI and explainable AI algorithms in image-based data analysis using the PlantVillage dataset to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases and spider mites as a case study.
